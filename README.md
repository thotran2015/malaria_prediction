# Malaria Prediction
This project is to predict whether or not blood cells are parasitized with malaria. I created (from scratch) and trained a ResNet model to predict cell images. The model was sitting in Google Colab so I thought I could deploy it to a web app where people could upload cell images to get diagnosis. My proposal for the malaria project is detailed in this attached document (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FExUArXrqmFxTGPTaF4UJatNs1_eoulZXG_s0ojI0sY/edit?usp=sharing).
