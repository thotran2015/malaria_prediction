# Malaria Prediction
This project is to predict whether or not blood cells are parasitized with malaria. I created (from scratch) and trained a ResNet model to predict cell images. The model was sitting in Google Colab so I thought I could deploy it to a web app where people can upload cell images to get diagnosis.
