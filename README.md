# Malaria Prediction
This project is to predict whether or not blood cells are parasitized with malaria. I created (from scratch) and trained a ResNet model to predict cell images. The model was sitting in Google Colab so I thought I could deploy it to a web app where people can upload cell images to get diagnosis. 

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.
